# TradeBotImageAnalysis
A simple architecture for a tradebot that I created for PERSONAL use to look at a stock's candlestick chart to predict the stocks movement. This should not be used to make finnacial decisions. 

The model is trained on a screenshot of an RSI and candlestick chart to predict whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Again, this is just for simulations.
